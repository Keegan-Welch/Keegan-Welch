Hello, My name is Keegan Welch. I am a highschool student who is interested in pursuing computer science (particularly software engineering or game design) as a career. I participated as a programmer in FIRST Robotics in my Freshman and Sophomore years. I am currently enrolled in AP Computer Science.

Throughout my journey in computing, I have used several languages such as:
* Python
* C#
* Javascript
* Java
* Lua

I am most comfortable programming in Java & Python, but I am capable of using other languages if necessary.

## Business Information
I am not currently seeking full-time employement due to having to attend school, but I would be willing to work part-time. if you'd like to contact me, you can email me at [keeganjamisonwelch@gmail.com](keeganjamisonwelch@gmail.com)
